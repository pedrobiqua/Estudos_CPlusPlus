# C++'s studies
C++ codes

In this I put the ideas of my c++ studies

## Hello world
My first c++ code
<br>

## Constructor
- Study of constructors <br>
A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.

## List
 - Study of list
<br>

## Pointers
 - Study of pointers <br>
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object. Pointers are used extensively in both C and C++ for three main purposes: to allocate new objects on the heap, to pass functions to other functions.

## Hash table
 - Study of hash table <br>
 A Hash Table in C/C++ (Associative array) is a data structure that maps keys to values. This uses a hash function to compute indexes for a key.
<br>
 
## Code Swap
 - Aplication of pointers <br>
 
## Binary tree
 - Study of binary tree <br>
A Binary tree is a widely used tree data structure. When each node of a tree has at most two child nodes then the tree is called a Binary tree.

## Abstract factory
 - Study of abstract factory in c++ <br>
Abstract Factory is creational software design pattern. This pattern provides interfaces for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. <br>
